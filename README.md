# Quantum-Machine-Learning
credit : This code is taken from microsoft half moon model ,available at Qsharp documentation page , with some modification and added preprocessing.
It contains implementation for different QML model implementation (based on half moon with added preprocessing ). Try different model architectures and preprocessing modes for different training_data to achieve higher accuracy.
The training dataset used are given from codeforces summer 2020 coding competetion : https://codeforces.com/contest/1357              
solutions are available here: https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/79208


The preprocessing methods are coded directly at train.qs with given modes.
I don't have uploaded trained model but It can be found at above solutions link or you can just train your own. data visualization is done in python and can be found at python notebook.

Run file host.cs with command <pre>dotnet run</pre> in powershell.   
Make sure to add same no of initial parameters in array as that of not of gates in model.
